# 'Wine-to-rule-them-all' - Proton-TkG advanced config file

##
##   This config file contains advanced settings for your build.
##   For the basic configuration, see ../proton-tkg.cfg
##

# This is a simplified config file with minimal comments. See ../../wine-tkg-git/wine-tkg-profiles/sample-external-config.cfg for more details.
# Some options will be missing from this config file compared to wine-tkg-git as they are enforced.

# Proton branch to target for lsteamclient libs and steam helper on 4.x+ - When using a Wine 3.x base, "proton_3.16" branch will be enforced
_proton_branch="proton_5.0"

# Proton SDL Joystick support, xinput hacks and other gamepad additions. _gamepad_additions depends on _sdl_joy_support.
_sdl_joy_support="true"
_gamepad_additions="false"

# Proton non-vr-related wined3d additions - Disabled on staging independently of this setting
_wined3d_additions="true"

# Disable nvapi and nvapi64 - Common fix for various games when using a Nvidia GPU
# Might create issues on some native vulkan game calling nvapi for some extremely dumb reason, such as Doom Eternal
_proton_nvapi_disable="false"

# Disable winedbg - (Used to fix GTA V online crash before Proton 5.0-4 02951753)
_proton_winedbg_disable="false"

# Enforce IMAGE_FILE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE - Fixes 32-bit games hitting address space limitations.
# *Some* games might not like that (only known case so far is System Shock 2).
_proton_force_LAA="true"

# Enable the use of winelib steam.exe to launch games that checks if Steam is running such as Assetto Corsa - Only works with a Wine 4.0+ base
# Will disable "server-Desktop_Refcount" and "ws2_32-TransmitFile" patchsets on staging past 4e7071e4 (4.7+)
_proton_use_steamhelper="true"

# Set to true to disable proton's steamclient lib substitution. Allows running windows steam client in proton (only affects 4.19+)
# ! This will prevent most Steam games to run directly from proton - You only want to use this as a secondary build for non-steam games or running windows steam/games from windows steam !

# Enable DXVK's async pipecompiler on a compatible DXVK build. Also known as the "poe hack", that option *could* be unsafe regarding anticheats, so beware !
